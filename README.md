## Description
I refactored this mobile-first Budget Tracker to include Progressive Web Application (PWA) funcationality, including offline persistence with IndexedDB and a web manifest. I also deployed the code to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas.

With this code, a user can enter a transaction along with the related income or expenditure to view their budgeting over time. If a user has poor or no connection, do not worry! A user's transactions will be cached and input into the budget tracker when the connection becomes stable. Users can also download the application to use on the go.

Original code was provided by the University of Texas at Austin coding bootcamp.

## Installation
If you would like to use the code, simply clone to code to your machine, open the code in your favorite IDE and run `npm start` in the console to start the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/` and use the budget tracker. The homepage will look something like the below image. Hopefully you are more in the black than I am!
